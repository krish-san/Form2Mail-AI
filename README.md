# Form2Mail - AI

This is a *completely unofficial* Google Form auto-reply systemâ€¦ themed around **army dogs in the MTA** (donâ€™t ask why).

Built using Google Apps Script and OpenAI's GPT API, this project automatically sends email replies to form submissions â€” powered by AI, of course.

I originally made this for fun (and also for the METI internship ðŸ‘€), but I'm uploading it here just in case you're curious or want to check it out.

## What it does

- Takes input from a Google Form 
- Sends that question to Gemini API   
- Emails a smart reply back to the user   
- All handled automatically using Apps Script   

## Technologies

- Google Forms + Apps Script  
- Gemini API ( or whatever you like)  
- Trigger-based automation
